# Good README Generator
  

# Good README Generator Guidelines

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The application will be invoked with the following command:

```
node index.js
```
This application uses the Trilogy Education Services standards from their Good README Guide to generate a README.md file for open source projects on GitHub. These standards include:
* information about what the app is for
* how to use the app
* how to install it
* how to report issues
* how to make contributions (so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project)
 
This command-line application streamlines the generation of a project README, allowing a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.


The specific features of the application are outlined in the acceptance criteria provided by the client. 

# Acceptance Criteria Requirements:
